# Kele's React Portfolio

ABOUT:

This is my current portfolio which includes a personal biography, information about my current works, and contact information. The bio page provides a visitor with the chance to get to know me better. Here, answers for common questions and a brief personal narative are provided.

PLEASE NOTE:

Currently, a workaround is used to deploy this frontend react router application to GitHub. One characteristic worth mentioning is the full rendering of the portfolio only becomes available after a page link is clicked on the initial page that loads. Before this click event, the home page will render only partially. Full functionality should be available after this step.

Thank you for your patience and understanding,

Kele
